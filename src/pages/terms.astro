                            as a reseller for upstream hosting providers (e.g., HostAfrica).
                            While we strive for 99.9% uptime, we cannot guarantee
                            uninterrupted service due to upstream network failures.

                            registered (e.g., yourcompany.co.za) remains the property
                            of the Client, provided the account is in good standing.

                            services or fails to pay, the domain name may expire.
                            The Provider is not liable for the loss of a domain name
                            due to non-payment.

                            unpaid for 60 days, the Provider reserves the right to
                            permanently delete all data (emails and website files)
                            from the server to recover storage space.

                            will be billed at the Provider’s standard hourly rate
                            (R450/hour).

                            is ultimately responsible for their own data. The Provider
